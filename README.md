üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Yonathan Daniel, a Master of Science in Computer Science student at Columbia University with a strong foundation in Computer Engineering from The Pennsylvania State University. As a tech enthusiast and problem solver, I leverage my expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing to develop innovative solutions that address real-world challenges. My passion lies in building scalable and efficient systems that harness the power of data and AI to drive impactful outcomes.

üëÄ I hold a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Engineering, where I graduated on the Dean‚Äôs List multiple semesters, and I‚Äôm currently pursuing advanced studies in areas like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and High-Performance Machine Learning. With hands-on experience in backend and full-stack development, I‚Äôve worked on projects ranging from AI-driven healthcare applications to autonomous robotics systems.  My goal is to continue bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical applications to create solutions that make a difference.
